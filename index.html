        <h2>Education</h2>
        <p>"I studied my primary school in a serene school tucked away in the countryside, called St. Francis Namawanga, where the mornings smelled of fresh grass and the afternoons echoed with laughter. In my high school, I honed my skills and discovered my passions at St. Joseph High School Kitale, surrounded by inspiring teachers and friends who became family. Currently, I'm pursuing my education at Kisii University, nestled in the heart of Kisii Town, where inspiration is as abundant as the coffee shop."</p>
